===CURRENTLY BROKEN ON BETA===

Makes Baetyls 3x more common, makes them always reward relics (though not always major ones) when they offer an item, and prevents them from offering artifacts as rewards.

Not intended to be balanced with the main game, I just think it's more fun this way.

Thank helado for teaching me how to do the harmony patch!
